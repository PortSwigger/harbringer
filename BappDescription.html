<p>HARBringer is a Burp Suite extension developed by Abira Security specifically designed to import HTTP Archive (HAR) files into Burps site map. Unlike other similar extensions, it ensures all the original HTTP requests and responses of your HAR file are preserved; this is to say, it does not request each entry in the HAR file upon importation but retains the originality of the requests and responses. With HARBringer, you can analyze previously captured traffic without the necessity to recapture it through Burps proxy.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
